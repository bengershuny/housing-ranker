The purpose of this app is to make the Brown Housing Lottery Process as efficient and effective as possible. This app takes in a set of data about housing options in the Brown Housing Lottery, room-by-room--including square footage, bathroom and room quality, and much more. Given this hard data, it allows you to define your preferences for a perfect room--such as preferring location of the dorm the most, then preferring bathroom quality as well, and not caring at all about room size; then given these defined preferences, it ranks all available remaining rooms for you to choose for the Brown Housing Lottery.
